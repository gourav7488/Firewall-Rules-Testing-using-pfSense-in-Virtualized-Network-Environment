# Firewall-Rules-Testing-using-pfSense-in-Virtualized-Network-Environment
Securing virtual network using pfSense firewall with simulated attack scenarios
# üìò Abstract

This project focuses on the implementation and testing of firewall rules using **pfSense**, an open-source firewall and router software, in a **virtualized network environment**. The primary objective is to simulate and analyze the behavior of network traffic when protected by pfSense under various configurations and potential attack scenarios.

The network setup is designed using **Oracle VirtualBox**, consisting of multiple virtual machines to replicate real-world conditions. The pfSense firewall acts as the central security appliance, configured with two network interfaces:
- An internal network connected to **Kali Linux** and **Windows 10** machines, representing internal users.
- An external bridged network connected to an **Ubuntu** machine, representing an external attacker.

The Ubuntu VM is used to simulate malicious activities such as **port scanning**, **brute force**, and **unauthorized access attempts**, while the pfSense firewall is configured with specific rules to detect and block such intrusions. Meanwhile, legitimate traffic from internal machines is allowed based on defined policies.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of pfSense in securing internal systems, managing traffic, and preventing unauthorized access. It also provides insights into firewall rule management, network segmentation, and the practical implementation of cybersecurity controls in virtualized environments.


# üìò Introduction

In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving digital landscape, ensuring robust network security is essential. Firewalls play a critical role in protecting internal systems from unauthorized access and external threats. This project focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating firewall rules using **pfSense**, an open-source firewall and routing platform.

To simulate a real-world enterprise environment, a virtual network is created using **Oracle VirtualBox**, where multiple machines represent internal users and external attackers. The internal network includes **Kali Linux** and **Windows 10** systems, while the external network is simulated using an **Ubuntu** machine configured as the attacker.

Through this project, we aim to understand how firewalls manage traffic flow, prevent attacks, and enforce network segmentation. By configuring and testing rules on pfSense, we gain hands-on experience in **network security management** and **threat mitigation**.

## Firewall Configuration:

Go to this link download the pfsense firewall: [Download pfSense Community Edition](https://www.pfsense.org/download/)

## Internal Server Configuration 

Now can go to the my server machine and try to access the Pfsense firewall in a Web.

But before that go the server machine and connect with internal network for pfsense firewall.

Go to kali machine click on the setting and move to Network setting and select Adapter 2 and Attached with internal Network.

<img width="940" height="587" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfcb6a31-bdc5-4906-b7a9-3a3074d0e277" />

Then start the kali machine. 

<img width="940" height="497" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f786f3c7-d1d9-4e45-88ca-63739d8a87f3" />

Now you can see my internal network connect with pfsense firewall LAN connection. So now I can access the pfsense firewall in web browser.

Pfsense default **login and password** credentials **admin:pfsense**

<img width="940" height="484" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd7893de-8fe3-46a8-831d-c46789299cd6" />

Now we have to do some pfsense setup and you don‚Äôt have to change anything simply move next.

<img width="940" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9c498e1-9ae1-4b1e-aa59-d7143689305a" />

So continue move next until you reached admin password section. In Step 2 you can see the password so you change the password here.

<img width="940" height="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6853431a-891d-409a-b313-46666b9fbc75" />

Now you can see you successful configure the firewall and complete the firewall.

After click on the Finish you come to Status Dashboard. 

In this dashboard you can see the some many things like Name of pfsense and username system virtulization.

<img width="940" height="464" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49ac91ad-883b-44a1-a977-54feec9a2a8b" />

Then go to the firewall section and set the Rules of firewalls.

<img width="940" height="376" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5db7b7f8-a08c-42a9-aafe-55623fa73867" />

Click on the add button. 
Set the Rule which is allow the access the private network.

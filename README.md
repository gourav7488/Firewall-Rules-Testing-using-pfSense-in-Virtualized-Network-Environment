# Firewall-Rules-Testing-using-pfSense-in-Virtualized-Network-Environment
Securing virtual network using pfSense firewall with simulated attack scenarios
# üìò Abstract

This project focuses on the implementation and testing of firewall rules using **pfSense**, an open-source firewall and router software, in a **virtualized network environment**. The primary objective is to simulate and analyze the behavior of network traffic when protected by pfSense under various configurations and potential attack scenarios.

The network setup is designed using **Oracle VirtualBox**, consisting of multiple virtual machines to replicate real-world conditions. The pfSense firewall acts as the central security appliance, configured with two network interfaces:
- An internal network connected to **Kali Linux** and **Windows 10** machines, representing internal users.
- An external bridged network connected to an **Ubuntu** machine, representing an external attacker.

The Ubuntu VM is used to simulate malicious activities such as **port scanning**, **brute force**, and **unauthorized access attempts**, while the pfSense firewall is configured with specific rules to detect and block such intrusions. Meanwhile, legitimate traffic from internal machines is allowed based on defined policies.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of pfSense in securing internal systems, managing traffic, and preventing unauthorized access. It also provides insights into firewall rule management, network segmentation, and the practical implementation of cybersecurity controls in virtualized environments.


# üìò Introduction

In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving digital landscape, ensuring robust network security is essential. Firewalls play a critical role in protecting internal systems from unauthorized access and external threats. This project focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating firewall rules using **pfSense**, an open-source firewall and routing platform.

To simulate a real-world enterprise environment, a virtual network is created using **Oracle VirtualBox**, where multiple machines represent internal users and external attackers. The internal network includes **Kali Linux** and **Windows 10** systems, while the external network is simulated using an **Ubuntu** machine configured as the attacker.

Through this project, we aim to understand how firewalls manage traffic flow, prevent attacks, and enforce network segmentation. By configuring and testing rules on pfSense, we gain hands-on experience in **network security management** and **threat mitigation**.


# üéØ Project Objectives and Tools Used

## ‚úÖ Objectives

1. To set up a secure virtual network environment using **pfSense** as the firewall system.
2. To configure internal and external networks using **VirtualBox** virtual machines.
3. To simulate attacks from an external network (**Ubuntu attacker**) towards internal systems.
4. To implement and evaluate **firewall rules** that allow or restrict specific types of traffic.
5. To analyze the effectiveness of **pfSense** in detecting and blocking unauthorized access.
6. To document and report findings on **network behavior**, **rule impact**, and **system protection**.
